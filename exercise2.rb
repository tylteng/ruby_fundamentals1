#Question 1
#Well firstly I would have to dictate what a proper tip should be.
#For the sake of the exercise I will say 15% so now I will work to make this calculation.
#So now I will tell the code to divide the total amount by 100 and then multiply that number by 15.

puts ( 55.0 / 100.0 ) * 15

#Question 2
#In order to solve this problem, the integer will have to be placed into a string.

puts "Hello" + "1"

#Question 3
#I will be placing the integers inside #{} which will then be included inside ""

puts "Hello class, #{45628*7839}!!"

#Question 4
#The boolean value of this expression is True.

puts (10 < 20 && 30 < 20) || !(10 == 11)
